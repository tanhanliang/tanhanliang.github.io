# Hey there! I'm Han Liang. 

I've started this programming blog to record stuff that I've done, for what better way is there to learn about programming than writing about it? Also, I probably won't remember everything I've done in detail, hence this blog. 

Some posts could be pretty banal stuff like "How to install X", while others could be aggregations of information for a particular question, such as "Hardware for a deep learning rig in 2018". 

I hope that the information in this site will be useful for you (and me)!
